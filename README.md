# Colocalisation
Trial pipeline in CellProfiler to identify VIP stained neurons, then TdTomato stained neurons, and then look for overlap. 

Update 07.06.22:
CellProfiler can't consistently recognise the axons for tdTomato cells, and much of VIP staining is localised to axons. Therefore analysis using CellProfiler for this image set was abandoned. Keeping the project online here as it will be useful for future stainings of round (i.e. soma) objects.
